--------------- DESCRIPTION ------------------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


A complete tennis court set with two benches and an umpire chair. It's ready to be integrated in your scene.Th fence and the net are made of a simple plan with a texture applied to them to keep the poly count as low as possible. The four sides of the fence are separated so you can hide and show each side as you like.

--------------- System requirements-----------------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


This product was created in Maya 2012 on a PC. It was not tested on other Version of Maya or on a MAC system. 
The POSER version of this product was created with Poser Pro 2012. it was not tested on an other version of Poser or Daz studio.

--------------- Installation Instructions ----------------------------------
____________________________________________________________________________


I placed all the files in the root folder, so you shouldn't get any problem loading the textures, with any 3D application. Just open the Maya files (.ma or .mb) or import the file format you like in an already exesting scene. You may need to adjuste the size of the model. 

When using the obj format, the transparency map for the fence and the net may not be imported. so you have to connected manually. To do so, you need to plug the transparency map located in the root folder of this model, to the transparency channel of the same piece (ex: plug TC_Fence_Trans.jpg to the transparency channel of the fence).   
For the poser version, you can directly open the pz3 file or place the content of the "POSERversion" folder in your Poser Runtime and load the Jetbike from Library. To do that, Copy the Runtime folder and paste it into your Poser directory. Every file should go to the right place.
